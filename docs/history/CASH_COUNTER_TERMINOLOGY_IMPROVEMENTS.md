## ✅ Implemented Changes

### 1. Close Counter Form - Simplified Terminology

**Before:**
```
Expected Closing Balance: ₹10,257
Your Count: ₹10,250
Difference: ₹7
Shortage - double check count
```

**After:**
```
📘 How Expected Cash is Calculated:
Opening Balance (₹9,000) + Today's Cash Sales (₹1,257) = Expected Cash (₹10,257)

What You Should Have: ₹10,257
What You Counted: ₹10,250
Cash Missing: ₹7
You counted less cash than expected - please recount
```

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Replaced "Expected Closing Balance" → "What You Should Have"
- ✅ Replaced "Your Count" → "What You Counted"
- ✅ Replaced "Difference" → "Cash Missing" / "Extra Cash Found"
- ✅ Replaced "Shortage" → "Cash Missing"
- ✅ Replaced "Excess" → "Extra Cash Found"
- ✅ Added calculation explainer with actual numbers
- ✅ Changed "verify count" → "please recount"

---

### 2. Verification Screen - Complete Explanation

**Before:**
```
Expected Closing: ₹10,257.00
Actual Closing: ₹10,250.00
Variance: ₹-7.00
```

**After:**
```
ℹ️ What does this mean?
The counter is closed. Owner needs to verify the cash count and acknowledge
any difference between expected and actual cash.

📊 How Cash Was Calculated:
Cash at Start (Opening Balance): ₹9,000
Cash from Sales Today: ₹1,257
─────────────────────────────
What You Should Have: ₹10,257.00

═════════════════════════════

```

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Added "What does this mean?" explainer section

### 3. Reopen Counter Feature

**New Functionality:**
- Added "Reopen Counter" button in verification screen
- Password-protected with owner password
- Requires explicit confirmation
- Clears closing data and returns counter to "Open" status

**Modal Content:**
```
🔓 Reopen Cash Counter?

Reopening will allow you to recount the cash. The counter will return to
"Open" status and you'll need to close and verify it again.

⚠️ Important:
Only reopen if you need to fix a counting mistake. This requires owner
password verification.

[Owner Password Field]
[Cancel] [Yes, Reopen Counter]
```

**Backend Endpoint:**
- `POST /api/v1/cash-counter/reopen/{counter_id}`
- Requires owner password verification
- Only works for counters in "closed_pending_verification" status
- Cannot reopen verified counters
- Clears all closing data (balance, denominations, variance, etc.)

**Code Location:**
- Frontend: `/frontend/src/pages/CashCounterPage.tsx` (lines 600-730)
- Backend: `/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/cash_counter.py` (lines 207-253)
